discord bot for the crypto currency Bitcoin. It displays the current BTC price, shows change of BTC price and it can calculate the price of certain amount of bitcoins

Librarys used:
- express
- discord.js
- btc-value 
- discord-webhook-node

this is a pretty old project of mine (that's why I'm using modules for everything instead of API's lmao) but after the account which hosted the bot got terminated, I decided to just release the source code. The code itself is pretty shitty but I think you can make something out of it so good luck.
